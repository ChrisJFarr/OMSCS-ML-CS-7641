Implement these randomized algorithms:
    randomized hill climbing
    simulated annealing
    a genetic algorithm
    MIMIC


You will then create (for sufficiently loose values of "create" including "steal", 
though it's fairly easy to come up with simple problems on your own in this case) 
three optimization problem domains

"optimization problem" is just a fitness function one is trying to maximize

Please note that the problems you create should be over discrete-valued parameter spaces. Bit strings are preferable.

You will apply **all four search techniques to these three** optimization problems. 12 total

* The first problem should highlight advantages of your genetic algorithm, 
* the second of simulated annealing, 
* and the third of MIMIC. Be creative and thoughtful. 
It is not required that the problems be complicated or painful. They can be simple. For example, the 4-peaks and 
k-color problems are rather straightforward, but illustrate relative strengths rather neatly.
(use 4-peaks, k-color, and one other)
my note: Perhaps try a few because I need to ensure a different algorithm does best for each (or similar pattern)


In addition to analyzing discrete optimization problems, you will also use the first three algorithms to 
find good weights for a neural network. In particular, you will use them instead of backprop for the neural 
network you used in assignment #1 on at least one of the problems you created for assignment #1. Notice 
that this assignment is about an optimization problem and about supervised learning problems. That probably 
means that looking at only the loss or only the accuracy wonâ€™t tell you the whole story. Luckily, you have 
already learned how to write an analysis on optimization problems and on supervised learning problems; now 
you just have to integrate your knowledge.

Apply randomized hill climbing, simulated annealing, and a genetic algorithm to the pytorch model...?


You must submit:

A file named README.txt that contains instructions for running your code and some way of getting to your code, just like last time.
a file named yourgtaccount-analysis.pdf that contains your writeup.
The file yourgtaccount-analysis.pdf should contain: 

the results you obtained running the algorithms on the networks: why did you get the results you did? what sort of changes might you make 
to each of those algorithms to improve performance? Feel free to include any supporting graphs or tables. And by "feel free to", of course, I mean "do".

a description of your optimization problems, and why you feel that they are interesting and exercise the strengths and weaknesses of each approach. Think hard about this.

analyses of your results. Beyond answering why you got the results you did you should compare and contrast the different algorithms. How fast 
were they in terms of wall clock time? Iterations? Which algorithm performed best? How do you define best? Be creative and think of as many questions 
you can, and as many answers as you can. You know the drill.

Note: Analysis writeup is limited to 10 pages total.
